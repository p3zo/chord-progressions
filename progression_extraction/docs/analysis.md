# Questions

Hypothesis: genre gives information about harmonic content

HC = harmonic content

Does any genre have characteristic HC?
(equiavalent) Can any genre be characterized by its HC?

Can any HC be characterized by the genres it appears in?

Define a relationship between genre and HC.

e.g. How often does a Maj7 chord appear in rock vs in trance? - absolute # of appearances per track (avg, std, median) - % of all chords per track (avg, std, median)

# Answers

One reason that genres may be characterized by harmonic content is that different genres use different instruments, each of which have different standard tunings and work best with different scales and chord types. For example, in metal music there are a handful of standard tunings for guitar and bass.

## TODO

-   use artist instead of genre to begin with. actually don't even split to begin with
